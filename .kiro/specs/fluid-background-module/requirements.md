# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting an existing fluid simulation React component into a reusable Next.js module that can be easily imported and used as a background element in any Next.js project. The module should provide a clean API for customization while maintaining the visual quality and performance of the original fluid simulation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Next.js developer, I want to install a fluid background module from npm, so that I can quickly add an interactive fluid simulation background to my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs `npm install fluid-background` THEN the module SHALL be installed as a dependency
2. WHEN the developer imports the module THEN it SHALL provide a default export that can be used as a React component
3. IF the module is not available on npm THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for local installation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to import and use the fluid background component with minimal setup, so that I can focus on my application logic rather than complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer imports the component THEN it SHALL work with a single import statement
2. WHEN the component is rendered THEN it SHALL automatically position itself as a background element
3. WHEN no props are provided THEN the component SHALL use sensible default values
4. WHEN the component mounts THEN it SHALL not interfere with other page elements or scrolling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the fluid simulation parameters, so that I can match the visual style to my application's design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer passes configuration props THEN the component SHALL accept parameters for colors, physics, and visual effects
2. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the component SHALL fall back to default values and log warnings
3. WHEN the component receives new props THEN it SHALL update the simulation parameters without restarting
4. IF performance parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL respect resolution and quality settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fluid background to be responsive and performant, so that it works well across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the component SHALL automatically resize the canvas
2. WHEN running on mobile devices THEN the component SHALL use optimized settings for performance
3. WHEN the component detects low performance THEN it SHALL automatically reduce quality settings
4. WHEN the page is not visible THEN the component SHALL pause or reduce animation to save resources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fluid background to handle touch and mouse interactions appropriately, so that users can interact with the simulation while still being able to use my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users move their mouse over the background THEN the fluid simulation SHALL respond with visual effects
2. WHEN users touch the screen on mobile THEN the simulation SHALL create appropriate fluid effects
3. WHEN users interact with foreground elements THEN the background SHALL not interfere with click events
4. WHEN the component is configured as non-interactive THEN it SHALL not respond to user input

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to implement and customize the fluid background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer accesses the documentation THEN it SHALL include installation instructions
2. WHEN the developer needs examples THEN the documentation SHALL provide code samples for common use cases
3. WHEN the developer wants to customize THEN the documentation SHALL list all available props and their effects
4. WHEN the developer encounters issues THEN the documentation SHALL include troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the module to be compatible with modern Next.js features, so that it works with SSR, app router, and other Next.js capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Next.js with SSR THEN the component SHALL handle client-side only rendering appropriately
2. WHEN using the app router THEN the component SHALL work without additional configuration
3. WHEN using TypeScript THEN the module SHALL provide proper type definitions
4. WHEN building for production THEN the component SHALL not cause hydration mismatches
