# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create an exact clone of the WebGL fluid dynamics cursor effect by implementing a single React component file that mirrors the original code structure completely.

---

- [x] 1. Copy original code exactly into new FluidCursor component
  - Create src/components/FluidCursor/FluidCursor.tsx
  - Copy the entire original code from original_code.md exactly as-is
  - Only change the export to match our file structure
  - Keep all prop names, interfaces, and logic identical
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 7.1_

- [-] 2. Test the copied component immediately
  - Create a simple test HTML file to verify it works
  - Import and render the FluidCursor component
  - Verify the fluid simulation runs and responds to mouse
  - Check for any immediate compilation or runtime errors
  - _Requirements: 6.3, 9.3_

- [ ] 3. Fix any import/export issues (if needed)
  - Adjust any TypeScript import/export syntax if necessary
  - Fix any React-specific issues that prevent compilation
  - Ensure proper default export for component usage
  - Keep all internal logic completely unchanged
  - _Requirements: 7.2, 7.3_

- [ ] 4. Create integration examples and documentation
  - Create working demo HTML file showing the component in use
  - Add the component to existing examples directory
  - Document the exact prop interface matching original
  - Verify cross-browser compatibility
  - _Requirements: 7.4, 9.1, 9.2_

- [ ] 5. Add to package exports (if working correctly)
  - Export the FluidCursor component from main package
  - Update package.json and index files if needed
  - Ensure it can be imported alongside existing components
  - Test npm package integration
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2_

## Success Criteria
- Single React component file that exactly matches original code structure
- Identical visual output to original reference implementation
- Smooth 60fps performance with proper WebGL fluid simulation
- All mouse and touch interactions work exactly as in original
- Proper React lifecycle management and cleanup
- Cross-browser compatibility with WebGL fallbacks
