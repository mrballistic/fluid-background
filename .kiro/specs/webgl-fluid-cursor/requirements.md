# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create an exact clone of the WebGL fluid dynamics cursor effect from the original reference code. The effect creates beautiful, flowing smoke-like trails through real-time fluid simulation using WebGL shaders, velocity fields, pressure calculations, and dye advection - not particle systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: WebGL Fluid Simulation Core

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see realistic fluid dynamics that respond to my cursor movement, so that I experience authentic smoke-like trails that flow and dissipate naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user moves their mouse THEN the system SHALL inject velocity into a WebGL velocity field at the cursor position
2. WHEN velocity is injected THEN the system SHALL perform fluid advection using WebGL shaders to move the velocity field
3. WHEN fluid moves THEN the system SHALL calculate divergence and apply pressure projection to maintain incompressible flow
4. WHEN fluid simulation runs THEN it SHALL use curl and vorticity calculations to create realistic swirling motion
5. WHEN dye is injected THEN it SHALL be advected by the velocity field to create visible trails

### Requirement 2: WebGL Shader Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use proper WebGL shaders for fluid calculations, so that the simulation runs efficiently on the GPU with realistic physics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL compile vertex and fragment shaders for fluid operations
2. WHEN performing advection THEN it SHALL use bilinear interpolation shaders for smooth field sampling
3. WHEN calculating pressure THEN it SHALL use iterative Jacobi method shaders for pressure projection
4. WHEN applying forces THEN it SHALL use splat shaders to inject velocity and dye at cursor position
5. WHEN rendering THEN it SHALL use display shaders with optional shading effects for visual enhancement

### Requirement 3: Framebuffer Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper double-buffering and texture management, so that the fluid simulation can read from and write to different textures each frame.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create double-buffered framebuffers for velocity and dye fields
2. WHEN performing simulation steps THEN it SHALL swap read/write framebuffers to avoid feedback loops
3. WHEN textures are created THEN they SHALL use appropriate floating-point formats for precision
4. WHEN the canvas resizes THEN it SHALL recreate framebuffers with correct dimensions
5. WHEN cleaning up THEN it SHALL properly dispose of all WebGL resources

### Requirement 4: Mouse Interaction System

**User Story:** As a user, I want my mouse movement to create fluid motion that feels responsive and natural, so that the interaction is intuitive and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user moves the mouse THEN the system SHALL calculate velocity from position delta
2. WHEN velocity is calculated THEN it SHALL be scaled appropriately for the simulation resolution
3. WHEN injecting forces THEN it SHALL use Gaussian splats with configurable radius and intensity
4. WHEN the user clicks THEN it SHALL create additional dye injection for enhanced visual effect
5. WHEN touch input occurs THEN it SHALL handle multi-touch with the same fluid injection logic

### Requirement 5: Fluid Physics Accuracy

**User Story:** As a user, I want the fluid to behave like real smoke or liquid, so that the visual effect is believable and satisfying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fluid moves THEN it SHALL conserve mass through proper divergence-free velocity fields
2. WHEN calculating pressure THEN it SHALL use sufficient iterations to maintain incompressible flow
3. WHEN applying vorticity THEN it SHALL enhance swirling motion for more interesting fluid behavior
4. WHEN dye dissipates THEN it SHALL fade gradually over time with configurable dissipation rates
5. WHEN velocity decays THEN it SHALL reduce over time to prevent infinite motion

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the fluid simulation to run smoothly at 60fps, so that the interaction feels responsive without lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation runs THEN it SHALL maintain 60fps on modern devices with WebGL support
2. WHEN WebGL2 is available THEN it SHALL use more efficient texture formats and operations
3. WHEN WebGL2 is unavailable THEN it SHALL fall back to WebGL1 with appropriate format adjustments
4. WHEN linear filtering is unsupported THEN it SHALL use manual bilinear interpolation in shaders
5. WHEN performance drops THEN it SHALL automatically reduce simulation resolution to maintain framerate

### Requirement 7: React Component Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily integrate the fluid cursor into React applications, so that I can add the effect with minimal setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing the component THEN it SHALL provide a clean React component interface
2. WHEN the component mounts THEN it SHALL initialize WebGL context and start the simulation
3. WHEN the component unmounts THEN it SHALL clean up all WebGL resources and event listeners
4. WHEN props change THEN it SHALL update simulation parameters without restarting
5. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL create a full-screen canvas overlay with proper z-index

### Requirement 8: Configuration Options

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the fluid simulation parameters, so that I can adjust the visual appearance to match my application's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring simulation THEN the developer SHALL be able to set resolution for velocity and dye fields
2. WHEN configuring physics THEN the developer SHALL be able to adjust dissipation rates for velocity and density
3. WHEN configuring forces THEN the developer SHALL be able to modify splat radius and force strength
4. WHEN configuring rendering THEN the developer SHALL be able to enable/disable shading effects
5. WHEN configuring colors THEN the developer SHALL be able to set background color and transparency

### Requirement 9: Cross-Browser WebGL Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the fluid effect to work across different browsers and devices, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome THEN the system SHALL use WebGL2 with optimal performance
2. WHEN using Firefox THEN the system SHALL work with both WebGL1 and WebGL2
3. WHEN using Safari THEN the system SHALL handle WebGL limitations and use appropriate fallbacks
4. WHEN WebGL is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade or show an appropriate message
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL handle touch events and adjust performance accordingly

### Requirement 10: Shader Compilation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust shader compilation and error handling, so that the system works reliably across different WebGL implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling shaders THEN the system SHALL check for compilation errors and log detailed information
2. WHEN linking programs THEN the system SHALL verify successful linking and report any issues
3. WHEN texture formats are unsupported THEN the system SHALL try fallback formats automatically
4. WHEN framebuffer creation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative configurations
5. WHEN WebGL context is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore and reinitialize the simulation
