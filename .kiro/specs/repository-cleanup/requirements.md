# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves a comprehensive cleanup of the fluid-background repository to remove all non-working code, incomplete implementations, and confusing artifacts. The goal is to create a clean, focused package that only contains the working FluidCursor component and its necessary supporting infrastructure, with clear documentation and proper package structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Cleanup and Removal

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want to remove all non-working and incomplete code, so that the repository only contains functional, tested components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all SplashCursor related code SHALL be completely removed
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all FluidBackground related code SHALL be completely removed  
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN only the working FluidCursor component and its dependencies SHALL remain
4. WHEN reviewing test files THEN only tests for remaining components SHALL be kept
5. WHEN reviewing examples THEN only examples demonstrating working functionality SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 2: Package Structure Simplification

**User Story:** As a developer using this package, I want a clear and simple package structure, so that I can easily understand what the package provides and how to use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json THEN it SHALL only export the FluidCursor component
2. WHEN examining the main index file THEN it SHALL only export working components and types
3. WHEN examining the package exports THEN they SHALL only include functional modules
4. WHEN examining the package name THEN it SHALL reflect the actual functionality (fluid-cursor vs fluid-background)
5. WHEN examining package keywords THEN they SHALL accurately describe the remaining functionality

### Requirement 3: Documentation Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer using this package, I want accurate and focused documentation, so that I understand exactly what the package does and how to use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README THEN it SHALL only describe the FluidCursor component functionality
2. WHEN reading the API documentation THEN it SHALL only document available components and their props
3. WHEN reading examples THEN they SHALL only show working implementations
4. WHEN reading the package description THEN it SHALL accurately reflect the current functionality
5. WHEN reviewing documentation files THEN they SHALL not reference removed components

### Requirement 4: Build System Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer building this package, I want a clean build system that only processes necessary files, so that build times are fast and output is minimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the package THEN it SHALL only compile remaining source files
2. WHEN examining build output THEN it SHALL only contain necessary components and utilities
3. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL only test existing functionality
4. WHEN examining build configuration THEN it SHALL be optimized for the remaining codebase
5. WHEN building for distribution THEN the output SHALL be minimal and focused

### Requirement 5: File System Organization

**User Story:** As a developer navigating this codebase, I want a clean and logical file structure, so that I can quickly find and understand the code organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the src directory THEN it SHALL only contain files related to working components
2. WHEN examining utility files THEN they SHALL only include utilities actually used by remaining components
3. WHEN examining type definitions THEN they SHALL only include types for existing functionality
4. WHEN examining test files THEN they SHALL be organized to match the simplified source structure
5. WHEN examining example files THEN they SHALL be reduced to only demonstrate working features

### Requirement 6: Dependency Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer installing this package, I want minimal dependencies, so that the package has a small footprint and fewer potential security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json dependencies THEN they SHALL only include packages actually used by remaining code
2. WHEN examining devDependencies THEN they SHALL only include tools needed for building and testing remaining functionality
3. WHEN examining peer dependencies THEN they SHALL accurately reflect the requirements of remaining components
4. WHEN running dependency analysis THEN there SHALL be no unused dependencies
5. WHEN installing the package THEN it SHALL have minimal impact on bundle size

### Requirement 7: Test Suite Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this package, I want a focused test suite that only tests existing functionality, so that CI/CD is fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL only test components that exist in the cleaned codebase
2. WHEN examining test coverage THEN it SHALL accurately reflect coverage of remaining code
3. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass consistently
4. WHEN examining test files THEN they SHALL not reference removed components or functionality
5. WHEN running performance tests THEN they SHALL only benchmark existing components

### Requirement 8: Example and Demo Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer learning to use this package, I want clear and working examples, so that I can quickly understand how to implement the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining example files THEN they SHALL only demonstrate the FluidCursor component
2. WHEN running example applications THEN they SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN examining demo HTML files THEN they SHALL only show working functionality
4. WHEN reviewing example documentation THEN it SHALL be accurate and up-to-date
5. WHEN testing examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate best practices for the remaining components

### Requirement 9: Configuration File Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer working with this codebase, I want clean configuration files that only contain settings relevant to the remaining functionality, so that the development environment is simple and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining TypeScript configuration THEN it SHALL only include settings needed for remaining code
2. WHEN examining build tool configuration THEN it SHALL be optimized for the simplified codebase
3. WHEN examining linting configuration THEN it SHALL only include rules relevant to remaining files
4. WHEN examining test configuration THEN it SHALL only test existing functionality
5. WHEN examining CI/CD configuration THEN it SHALL be streamlined for the cleaned codebase

### Requirement 10: Version and Release Preparation

**User Story:** As a developer preparing to release this cleaned package, I want proper versioning and release notes, so that users understand the breaking changes and new focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing the release THEN the version SHALL be bumped to indicate breaking changes
2. WHEN examining the changelog THEN it SHALL clearly document what was removed and why
3. WHEN examining release notes THEN they SHALL explain the new focused scope of the package
4. WHEN examining migration documentation THEN it SHALL help users transition from the old package structure
5. WHEN publishing the package THEN it SHALL include clear deprecation notices for removed functionality
