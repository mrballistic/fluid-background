# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create an exact clone of the splash cursor effect from https://www.reactbits.dev/animations/splash-cursor. The effect creates beautiful, flowing smoke-like trails that follow the user's cursor movement, with realistic fluid dynamics and smooth visual blending.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cursor Following Effect

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see beautiful fluid trails that follow my cursor movement, so that I can experience an engaging and interactive visual effect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user moves their mouse THEN the system SHALL create fluid trails that originate from the cursor position
2. WHEN the user moves the mouse quickly THEN the system SHALL create more intense and longer trails
3. WHEN the user moves the mouse slowly THEN the system SHALL create subtle, gentle trails
4. WHEN the user stops moving the mouse THEN the existing trails SHALL continue to flow and gradually fade away

### Requirement 2: Fluid Visual Appearance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the trails to look like flowing smoke or liquid, so that the effect appears realistic and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trails are created THEN they SHALL appear as connected, flowing shapes rather than discrete particles
2. WHEN multiple trails overlap THEN they SHALL blend together smoothly to create unified fluid shapes
3. WHEN trails move THEN they SHALL maintain smooth, organic boundaries without pixelated edges
4. WHEN trails fade THEN they SHALL transition smoothly from visible to transparent

### Requirement 3: Performance Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want the effect to run smoothly without lag, so that the interaction feels responsive and natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the effect is running THEN it SHALL maintain at least 60 FPS on modern devices
2. WHEN the effect is running THEN it SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS on older devices
3. WHEN many trails are present THEN the system SHALL manage particle count to maintain performance
4. WHEN the browser tab is not visible THEN the system SHALL pause or reduce the effect to save resources

### Requirement 4: Visual Styling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the trails to have beautiful, dynamic colors, so that the effect is visually striking and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trails are created THEN they SHALL use vibrant, rainbow-like colors that cycle over time
2. WHEN trails move THEN their colors SHALL shift based on velocity and direction
3. WHEN trails fade THEN their colors SHALL maintain saturation while reducing opacity
4. WHEN trails overlap THEN their colors SHALL blend naturally using additive color mixing

### Requirement 5: Edge Interaction

**User Story:** As a user, I want the trails to interact naturally with screen boundaries, so that the effect feels physically realistic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trails reach the edge of the screen THEN they SHALL bounce back with realistic physics
2. WHEN trails bounce THEN they SHALL lose some energy and velocity
3. WHEN trails bounce THEN they SHALL maintain their visual continuity and color
4. WHEN trails bounce multiple times THEN they SHALL gradually lose momentum

### Requirement 6: NPM Module Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily install and use this effect as an NPM package, so that I can add it to my projects with standard package management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the package THEN it SHALL be available via `npm install fluid-react`
2. WHEN importing the package THEN it SHALL provide both React component and vanilla JS options
3. WHEN using the React component THEN it SHALL accept configuration props for customization
4. WHEN the component mounts THEN it SHALL automatically start the effect
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN it SHALL clean up all resources and event listeners
6. WHEN using vanilla JS THEN it SHALL provide a simple API for initialization and cleanup

### Requirement 7: Customization Options

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the effect's appearance and behavior, so that I can match it to my application's design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the effect THEN the developer SHALL be able to adjust trail intensity
2. WHEN configuring the effect THEN the developer SHALL be able to modify color schemes
3. WHEN configuring the effect THEN the developer SHALL be able to control particle count and lifetime
4. WHEN configuring the effect THEN the developer SHALL be able to enable/disable edge bouncing

### Requirement 8: Package Distribution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to be properly built and distributed, so that I can use it in different project setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL provide ESM and CommonJS builds
2. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL include TypeScript definitions
3. WHEN the package is published THEN it SHALL include proper package.json metadata
4. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL work with bundlers like Webpack, Vite, and Rollup

### Requirement 9: Code Reuse and Integration

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want to reuse existing fluid simulation infrastructure, so that we build upon proven, working code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the splash cursor THEN it SHALL reuse existing fluid simulation components where applicable
2. WHEN implementing the splash cursor THEN it SHALL leverage existing WebGL infrastructure if performance benefits exist
3. WHEN implementing the splash cursor THEN it SHALL extend existing hooks and utilities rather than duplicating functionality
4. WHEN implementing the splash cursor THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with existing fluid-react API patterns

### Requirement 10: Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the effect to work consistently across different browsers, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome THEN the effect SHALL work with full functionality
2. WHEN using Firefox THEN the effect SHALL work with full functionality  
3. WHEN using Safari THEN the effect SHALL work with full functionality
4. WHEN using Edge THEN the effect SHALL work with full functionality
